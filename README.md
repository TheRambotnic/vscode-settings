# Visual Studio Code Settings
These are the settings, keybinds, extensions and snippets that I use for Visual Studio Code.

## Extensions
You don't necessarily need them, but they're a cool addition to VS Code :)

* [open in browser](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=techer.open-in-browser)

## For Windows users
After downloading the files, place them in `%appdata%/Code/User/`.

## For Linux users
After downloading the files, place them in `home/YourUserName/.config/Code/User`.

## Keybindings
If you'd like to know the keybinds available, you can open `keybindings.json` which contains comments 
explaining what each keybind do.
